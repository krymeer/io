# Computer games (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Gry komputerowe)
My own implementation of MDN's **2D Breakout Game** that is loosely based on Arcanoid and other similar products.  
This app was built by using only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.  
Feel free to re-use it and give me any feedback you want.  

### TODO
* At least one extra level (faster speed?).
* Bricks could move just like in the original (Arcanoid).
* The game ought to pause if there is no focus on its parent window.
* Collisions between the ball and the bricks should be better in a better way.
* The paddle (when moved by the mouse) is able to leave the canvas (partly).
* There ought to be more bricks than now.
* Each collision could be accompanied by sound.
